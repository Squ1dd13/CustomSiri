# CustomSiri
The code to give Siri custom responses on iOS 11. This will work as a tweak in its current form, but this is here for other people to use.

A working example of this code is available in [my SmallSiri fork](https://github.com/Squ1dd13/SmallSiri/blob/c7c4d8b25e79df44272946cd964554b077ad4005/Tweak.xm#L230).
